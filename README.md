Teaching approach.

# Description.

I taught a first year applied mathematics course "ODEs and Probablity (AM1201B)" in 2020 and 2021. The 2020 semester was mostly in person. The 2021 was delivered online.  

As trained, I made minute-wise lesson plans. I prepared material for all abilities ensuring that there was extension for the high ability student and help for those who needed it. I provided notes and examples to assist uptake of the specification. My preparation and engagement approach can be seen in the sample notes and powerpoint slides. I also provided extra sessions for smaller group to practice prior to exams, see the sub-directories. I summarized each lesson and allowed time for question and answers by always being the last to leave the classroom/zoom meeting. I provided regular office hours.
