# Write copious comments to explain what you do.
#
#
# include your modules.
#
#
#
# initialise all variables and lists. That includes list pointers.
#
#
# do your for loop, or while loop to solve y' = -100 y, y(0) = 1 in t (0, 4]. first do small number of S (large h)
# , then do large number of S (smaller h).
# Within or without the loop, work out exact solution at exactly the same time points.
# Hint: Everything inside a loop is at a tab in relation to start of loop.
#
#
# plot, write to data file, find difference between exact and numerical solution.
